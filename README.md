Welcome to my GitHub page. Within here you will find a few files:

## COVIDApp.R  

This R code contains the brains behind the app. The app takes data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv). You can get to it here as well: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv. The app automatically downloads the most recent dataset from the webpage everytime the app is opened. The app allows you to pick between COVID cases and deaths, selected a continent and any combination of countries within the selected continent, and a date range. When you are satisfied with your selections, click on the "Apply" button. The app then graphs a trending plot of the selected metrics along with a daily graph.

These files are downloaded from the link above on their respective days. The app currently uses the most recent data on the webpage, but this file is an example of what the data looks like.
